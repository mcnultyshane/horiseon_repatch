## HTML page patches

When reviewing the html of the website, there were noticeable fixes needed.  I repaired the nav bar to link to the three section at the bottom of the page.

I replaced the title of the page to the company's name along with another small tag-line.

The main edits to the html page was the removal of 'div' tags and replaced with appropriate HTML semantic language (i.e, header, section, aside, footer)

## CSS corrections.

The CSS stylesheet had groups of css code that were repetitive for certain sections of the webpage.  I consolidated the CSS to one 'encompassing' code an then changed labels and directions in the HTML accordingly.

The 'div' tabs were corrected in CSS to the correct pathways that resulted from the update to the HTML semantic language.  


## Git Commit Issues

My original git commits messages refer to changes to the document on 5/25.  Those changes were ultimately removed on 5/26 after an error in my git pull was repaired in class.  Document was restarted on 5/26 and changes began a new, however still witnessing an error now on 5/26 during 'git add -A' that is prohibiting me from adding continued 'git commit -m' messages to continued progress.  Will troubleshoot with Leif on 5/27 am.

# <Your-Project-Title>
## Description
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?
## Table of Contents (Optional)
If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)
## Installation
What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.
## Usage
Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
## Credits
List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.
If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.
If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.
## License
The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.
## Badges
![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/nielsenjared/badmath)
Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
## Features
If your project has a lot of features, list them here.
## How to Contribute
If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
## Tests
Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
