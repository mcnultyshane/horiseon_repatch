# Horiseon Repatch

## Project Description

This Project was a patch repair for the webpage of the company Horiseon.  There was web funcitonality that needed correction along with making certain the webpage accommodates for accessability.  The changes and repairs to the webpage that I have made will be listed below.  

- HTML page patches

When reviewing the html of the website, there were noticeable fixes needed.  To begin with, I repaired the nav bar to link to the three section at the bottom of the page.

Next, I replaced the title of the page to the company's name along with another small tag-line.

Moreover, The main edits to the html page was the removal of 'div' tags and replaced with appropriate HTML semantic language (i.e, header, section, aside, footer)

- CSS corrections.

I added comments to the CSS page to describe the where on the HTML form that these changes took place. 

The 'div' tabs were corrected in CSS to the correct pathways that resulted from the update to the HTML semantic language.  

The CSS stylesheet had groups of css code that were repetitive for certain sections of the webpage.  I consolidated the CSS to one 'encompassing' code an then changed labels and directions in the HTML accordingly.
